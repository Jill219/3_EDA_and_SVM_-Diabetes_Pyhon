# 3. EDA and Machine Learning for Diabetes data by Pyhon  

*12/2018*. 

### Objects:  
Conduct exploratory analysis and utilize sci-kit learn to train and test a support vector machine (SVM) to detect diabetes.  

### Steps:            
**EDA:**    
   * Cleaning data.  
   * Descriptive Statistics.  
   * Visualization of important analysis.  
   * Correlation and Visualization.    
   
**ML:**
   * Split into train and test sets.
   * Impute Na.
   * Scale the data.
   * Train the SVM models with "rbf" and "polynomial" kernel and hyperparameter tuning.
   * Use confusion matrix to evaluate the models.
